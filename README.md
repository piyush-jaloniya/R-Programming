This project, titled "Data Analysis and Visualization," focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using R programming on the "Top 100 IMDb Movies" dataset from Kaggle. The project's main objectives include:

Dataset Preparation: Selecting a suitable dataset, loading it into R, and performing essential cleaning, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and potential feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Calculating key statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical variables and frequency distributions for categorical ones.
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Employing histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to explore individual variables and relationships between them.
Outlier Detection: Identifying anomalies in continuous data, primarily through visualization techniques like boxplots.
Data Visualization: Using R to create insightful visualizations that clarify data distribution and variable relationships, including histograms for distribution patterns and scatter plots for relational analysis.

Insights and Conclusion: Summarizing key observations, including any trends, outliers, or correlations between variables.

Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, students gain practical experience in R programming for EDA, learning data cleaning, visualization, and insight derivation techniques essential for data-driven decision-makingâ€‹
